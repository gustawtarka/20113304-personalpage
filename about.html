        <p>Below is a short story of my life. I also added a quote I find interesting above every part.
        </p>
        <h3>Part 1</h3>
        <blockquote>"He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it."" - George Orwell (Shooting and elephant)</blockquote>
        <p>
            I was born during October, year 2005, in a large town located in central Poland. For the first few years of my life, I was a resident in the same country. When it came to school and activities, I was mediocre. At school, I enjoyed subjects that didnâ€™t require much repetitive work, for example, math. Due to my mother's occupation, at the end of 'Part 1,' as I called it here, of my life, my family moved to Sweden. It was quite weird for me, as I imagine it would be for anyone when moving to another country.
        </p>
        <h3>Part 2</h3>
        <blockquote>It takes something more than intelligence to act intelligently.  - Fyodor Dostoyevsky (Crime and punishment)</blockquote>
        <p>
            In the second part of my life, when my family moved to Sweden, things became slightly more difficult. I needed some time to get accustomed to the new country and learn the language.
        </p>
        <h3>Part 3</h3>
        <blockquote>The greatest happiness is to know that you are not alone, that there is someone to understand you. - Fyodor Dostoyevsky (Crime and punishment)</blockquote>
        <p>
            The last complete part for now was the 3rd part. This was the time when I went to high school and acquired the IB diploma. It was a difficult time because of the amount of things I needed to learn and understand. In the IB, I had 6 subjects and 3 extra ones. The ones that I chose to 'extend' were Math, Physics, and Computer Science. I finished the IB with an okay score and received my diploma. Thanks to that, I applied to SETU.
